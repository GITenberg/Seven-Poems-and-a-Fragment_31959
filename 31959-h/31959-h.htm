<h3>ALL SOULS&rsquo; NIGHT</h3>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&rsquo;Tis All Souls&rsquo; Night and the great Christ Church bell,</p>
<p>And many a lesser bell, sound through the room,</p>
<p>For it is now midnight;</p>
<p>And two long glasses brimmed with muscatel</p>
<p>Bubble upon the table. A ghost may come,</p>
<p>For it is a ghost&rsquo;s right,</p>
<p>His element is so fine</p>
<p>Being sharpened by his death,</p>
<p>To drink from the wine-breath</p>
<p>While our gross palates drink from the whole wine.</p>

<p class="s">I need some mind that, if the cannon sound</p>
<p>From every quarter of the world, can stay</p>
<p>Wound in mind&rsquo;s pondering,</p>
<p>As mummies in the mummy-cloth are wound;</p>
<p>Because I have a marvellous thing to say,</p>
<p>A certain marvellous thing</p>
<p>None but the living mock,</p>
<p>Though not for sober ear;</p>
<p>It may be all that hear</p>
<p>Should laugh and weep an hour upon the clock.</p>

<p class="s"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>2</span></p>
<p>H&mdash;&rsquo;s the first I call. He loved strange thought</p>
<p>And knew that sweet extremity of pride</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called platonic love,</p>
<p>And that to such a pitch of passion wrought</p>
<p>Nothing could bring him, when his lady died,</p>
<p>Anodyne for his love.</p>
<p>Words were but wasted breath;</p>
<p>One dear hope had he:</p>
<p>The inclemency</p>
<p>Of that or the next winter would be death.</p>

<p class="s">Two thoughts were so mixed up I could not tell</p>
<p>Whether of her or God he thought the most,</p>
<p>But think that his mind&rsquo;s eye,</p>
<p>When upward turned, on one sole image fell,</p>
<p>And that a slight companionable ghost,</p>
<p>Wild with divinity,</p>
<p>Had so lit up the whole</p>
<p>Immense miraculous house,</p>
<p>The Bible promised us,</p>
<p>It seemed a gold-fish swimming in a bowl.</p>

<p class="s"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>3</span></p>
<p>On Florence Emery I call the next,</p>
<p>Who finding the first wrinkles on a face</p>
<p>Admired and beautiful,</p>
<p>And knowing that the future would be vexed</p>
<p>With &rsquo;minished beauty, multiplied commonplace,</p>
<p>Preferred to teach a school,</p>
<p>Away from neighbour or friend</p>
<p>Among dark skins, and there</p>
<p>Permit foul years to wear</p>
<p>Hidden from eyesight to the unnoticed end.</p>

<p class="s">Before that end much had she ravelled out</p>
<p>From a discourse in figurative speech</p>
<p>By some learned Indian</p>
<p>On the soul&rsquo;s journey. How it is whirled about,</p>
<p>Wherever the orbit of the moon can reach,</p>
<p>Until it plunged into the sun;</p>
<p>And there free and yet fast,</p>
<p>Being both Chance and Choice,</p>
<p>Forget its broken toys</p>
<p>And sink into its own delight at last.</p>

<p class="s"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>4</span></p>
<p>And I call up MacGregor from the grave,</p>
<p>For in my first hard springtime we were friends,</p>
<p>Although of late estranged.</p>
<p>I thought him half a lunatic, half knave,</p>
<p>And told him so, but friendship never ends;</p>
<p>And what if mind seem changed,</p>
<p>And it seem changed with the mind,</p>
<p>When thoughts rise up unbid</p>
<p>On generous things that he did</p>
<p>And I grow half contented to be blind.</p>

<p class="s">He had much industry at setting out,</p>
<p>Much boisterous courage, before loneliness</p>
<p>Had driven him crazed;</p>
<p>For meditations upon unknown thought</p>
<p>Make human intercourse grow less and less;</p>
<p>They are neither paid nor praised.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;d object to the host,</p>
<p>The glass because my glass;</p>
<p>A ghost-lover he was</p>
<p>And may have grown more arrogant being a ghost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>5</span></p>
<p class="s">But names are nothing. What matter who it be,</p>
<p>So that his elements have grown so fine</p>
<p>The fume of muscatel</p>
<p>Can give his sharpened palate ecstasy</p>
<p>No living man can drink from the whole wine.</p>
<p>I have mummy truths to tell</p>
<p>Whereat the living mock,</p>
<p>Though not for sober ear,</p>
<p>For maybe all that hear</p>
<p>Should laugh and weep an hour upon the clock.</p>

<p class="s">Such thought&mdash;such thought have I that hold it tight</p>
<p>Till meditation master all its parts,</p>
<p>Nothing can stay my glance</p>
<p>Until that glance run in the world&rsquo;s despite</p>
<p>To where the damned have howled away their hearts,</p>
<p>And where the blessed dance;</p>
<p>Such thought, that in it bound</p>
<p>I need no other thing</p>
<p>Wound in mind&rsquo;s wandering,</p>
<p>As mummies in the mummy-cloth are wound.</p>

<h3>SUGGESTED BY A PICTURE OF A BLACK
CENTAUR</h3>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>Your hooves have stamped at the black margin of the wood,</p>
<p>Even where the horrible green parrots call and swing.</p>
<p>My works are all stamped down into the sultry mud.</p>
<p>I knew that horse play, knew it for a murderous thing.</p>
<p>What wholesome sun has ripened is wholesome food to eat</p>
<p>And that alone, yet I being driven half insane</p>
<p>Because of some green wing, gathered old mummy wheat</p>
<p>In the mad abstract dark and ground it grain by grain</p>
<p>And after baked it slowly in an oven; but now</p>
<p>I bring full flavoured wine out of a barrel found</p>
<p>Where seven Ephesian topers slept and never knew</p>
<p>When Alexander&rsquo;s empire past, they slept so sound.</p>
<p>Stretch out your limbs and sleep a long Saturnian sleep;</p>
<p>I have loved you better than my soul for all my words,</p>
<p>And there is none so fit to keep a watch and keep</p>
<p>Unwearied eyes upon those horrible green birds.</p>

<h3>THOUGHTS UPON THE PRESENT
STATE OF THE WORLD.</h3>


<h5>I</h5>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>Many ingenious lovely things are gone</p>
<p>That seemed sheer miracle to the multitude;</p>
<p>Above the murderous treachery of the moon</p>
<p>Or all that wayward ebb and flow. There stood</p>
<p>Amid the ornamental bronze and stone</p>
<p>An ancient image made of olive wood;</p>
<p>And gone are Phidias&rsquo; carven ivories</p>
<p>And all his golden grasshoppers and bees.</p>

<p class="s">We too had many pretty toys when young;</p>
<p>A law indifferent to blame or praise</p>
<p>To bribe or threat; habits that made old wrong</p>
<p>Melt down, as it were wax in the sun&rsquo;s rays;</p>
<p>Public opinion ripening for so long</p>
<p>We thought it would outlive all future days.</p>
<p>O what fine thought we had because we thought</p>
<p>That the worst rogues and rascals had died out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>8</span></p>
<p class="s">All teeth were drawn, all ancient tricks unlearned,</p>
<p>And a great army but a showy thing;</p>
<p>What matter that no cannon had been turned</p>
<p>Into a ploughshare; parliament and king</p>
<p>Thought that unless a little powder burned</p>
<p>The trumpeters might burst with trumpeting</p>
<p>And yet it lack all glory; and perchance</p>
<p>The guardsmen&rsquo;s drowsy chargers would not prance.</p>

<p class="s">Now days are dragon-ridden, the nightmare</p>
<p>Rides upon sleep: a drunken soldiery</p>
<p>Can leave the mother, murdered at her door,</p>
<p>To crawl in her own blood, and go scot-free;</p>
<p>The night can sweat with terror as before</p>
<p>We pieced our thoughts into philosophy,</p>
<p>And planned to bring the world under a rule</p>
<p>Who are but weasels fighting in a hole.</p>

<p class="s">He who can read the signs nor sink unmanned</p>
<p>Into the half-deceit of some intoxicant</p>
<p>From shallow wits, who knows no work can stand,</p>
<p>Whether health, wealth or peace of mind were spent</p>
<p>On master work of intellect or hand,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>9</span></p>
<p>No honour leave its mighty monument,</p>
<p>Has but one comfort left: all triumph would</p>
<p>But break upon his ghostly solitude.</p>

<p class="s">And other comfort were a bitter wound:</p>
<p>To be in love and love what vanishes.</p>
<p>Greeks were but lovers; all that country round</p>
<p>None dared admit, if such a thought were his,</p>
<p>Incendiary or bigot could be found</p>
<p>To burn that stump on the Acropolis,</p>
<p>Or break in bits the famous ivories</p>
<p>Or traffic in the grasshoppers or bees?</p>

<p>I am jealous of the looks men turn on you</p>

<p>It is as though you praise another, or even</p>
<p>Mock me with praise of my mere opposite;</p>

<h3>NOTE ON &lsquo;THOUGHTS UPON THE PRESENT
STATE OF THE WORLD&rsquo; SECTION
SIX.</h3>


<p>The country people see at times certain apparitions
whom they name now &lsquo;fallen angels&rsquo; now &lsquo;ancient
inhabitants of the country,&rsquo; and describe as riding
at whiles &lsquo;with flowers upon the heads of the horses.&rsquo;
I have assumed in the sixth poem that these horsemen,
now that the times worsen, give way to worse.
My last symbol Robert Artisson was an evil spirit
much run after in Kilkenny at the start of the fourteenth
century. Are not those who travel in the
whirling dust also in the Platonic Year?&mdash;W. B. Y.</p>

<h3>NOTE ON THE NEW END TO &lsquo;THE
KING&rsquo;S THRESHOLD&rsquo;</h3>


<p>Upon the revival of this play at the Abbey Theatre
a few weeks ago it was played with this new end.
There were a few other changes. I had originally
intended to end the play tragically and would have
done so but for a friend who used to say &lsquo;O do write
comedy &amp; have a few happy moments in the Theatre.&rsquo;
My unhappy moments were because a tragic
effect is very fragile and a wrong intonation, or even
a wrong light or costume will spoil it all. However
the play remained always of the nature of tragedy
and so subject to vicissitude.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
